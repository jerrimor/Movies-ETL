# Movies-ETL

## Overview of Project
Amazing Prime Video wants to obtain the insider knowledge of which low budget movies are popular so they can purchase them for their streaming service.  The company wants to use two sources of data to analyze and build an algorithm to predict the upcoming popular movies. They are hosting a hack-a-thon in the hopes that the participants will help in creating the solution.  For the hack-a-thon to be successful they need a clean data set.  This challenge was to successfully clean three data sources so that the participants will have the cleaned data.  

## Summary
Two csv files and one json file are the data sources provided for the hack-a-thon.  There were several iterations of cleaning of the data completed so that items like null values or columns that are mostly empty could be removed from the dataset. The final step was to import the entire datasets to a SQL database for the hack-a-thon participants to utilize. The entire Extract Transform and Load (ETL) process was completed within this project. A movies table was created containing over 6,000 rows and the second table titled ratings was created and that table has over 26 million rows.  The clean data is now prepped for the hack-a-thon participants and they can perform queries in SQL with good, accurate data.
